# Overview
In the music industry, A&R divisions have traditionally been responsible for talent scouting through methods like “gut feeling” and relying on “tastemakers” in the industry. This can be an issue for new artists looking to make a name for themselves but may not be necessarily be well connected. With artists increasing using social media channels and the barrier of entry to create music getting lower and lower, A&R divisions may be stymied in the decision making process.

I built an application called “Can it Chart?”, which uses song features from Spotify to predict whether a song has the ability to appear on the BillBoard Hot 100.
